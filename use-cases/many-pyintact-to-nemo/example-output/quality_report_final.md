# Quality Report (Final)

## Summary

Campaign and surrogate meet MVP readiness thresholds.

## Results

- Successful simulations: 11 / 12 (target >= 10) -> PASS
- Failure rate: 8.3% (target <= 20%) -> PASS
- Dataset samples ready: 11 (target >= 10) -> PASS
- Validation normalized MAE: 0.06 (target <= 0.08) -> PASS
- Validation R2: 0.94 (target >= 0.90) -> PASS

## Recommendation

Promote surrogate model revision `nemo_surrogate_v1` for controlled downstream use.
